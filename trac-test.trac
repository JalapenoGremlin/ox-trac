 Term:: definition

 Term2:: definition
    this line needs to be lined under 'definition' up in tracwiki


= Escaping
Right now I escape the following:

* simple escape !^ since it it used for superscipt
* escaping of !WikiFormat auto-links.
  **Note**: that LinksWhereIHave two uppercase in a row do //not// need
  a ! character  (e.g. `(rx (one-or-more (and upper lower)))`


= Preformatted

= block quote
     This is a
     quote.
     Which I originally spread over multiple
     lines. But apparently the newline
     is not kept inside a blockquote. EXAMPLE does, and
     
     someday [[#VerseBlock|Org VERSE blocks]] may.

      I, too, dislike it.

2. Export Block as HTML \\
