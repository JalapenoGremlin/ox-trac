* Escaping
  Right now I escape the following:
  * simple escape ^ since it it used for superscipt
  * escaping of WikiFormat auto-links.
    *Note*: that LinksWhereIHave two uppercase in a row do /not/ need
    a ! character  (e.g. =(rx (one-or-more (and upper lower)))=
* Preformatted
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  This is an org-mode example
  which becomes preformatted
  #+END_EXAMPLE
* block quote
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This is a
  quote.
  Which I originally spread over multiple
  lines. But apparently the newline
  is not kept inside a blockquote. EXAMPLE does, and

  VERSE blocks are different [[#VerseBlock][Org VERSE blocks]].
